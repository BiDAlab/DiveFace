# DiveFace Dataset
DiveFace contains annotations equally distributed among six classes related to gender and ethnicity (male, female and three ethnic groups). Gender and ethnicity have been annotated following a semi-automatic process. There are 24K identities (4K for class). The average number of images per identity is 5.5 with a minimum number of 3 for a total number of images greater than 150K. Users are grouped according to their gender (male or female) and three categories related with ethnic physical characteristics:

·         East Asian: people with ancestral origin in Japan, China, Korea and other countries in that region.

·         Sub-Saharan and South Indian: people with ancestral origins in Sub-Saharan Africa, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, among others. 

·         Caucasian: people with ancestral origins from Europe, North-America and Latin-America (with European origin).

We are aware about the limitations of grouping all human ethnic origins into only 3 categories. According to studies, there are more than 5K ethnic groups in the world. We categorized according to only three groups in order to maximize differences among classes.  

Dataset available soon.
